# Frequently Asked Questions

Please read this list completely **before** you open an issue or your issue may be closed.

## Are you associated with NextDNS? Is this an official app?

No, this is **not** an official app and I have no ties at all to NextDNS. Unfortunately, this means that the addition of certain features won't be possible. Read more about this below.

## What happened to the official NextDNS app?

The official app appears to have been taken down. On Google Play, there are a number of reasons why an app may be removed or "unlisted", including violation of Google Play policies, requests from the developers themselves, or other reasons. Since I'm not affiliated with the developers, I'm not sure why this has happened or if/when the official app will return.

## What features won't be able to be added to this app since it's not official?

Unless NextDNS/Android make major changes, there are a few features that won't be able to be added. These include:

- Toggle on/off of NextDNS protection, through quick toggles and other means. This is a limitation of Android.
- Connecting through a VPN to NextDNS as was available in the official app. Since I don't have access to official infastructure, there is no VPN server available to facilitate a connection to.
- Changes (additions, removals, edits) to block lists or any of the parental control features.
- Addition of [NXEnhanced](https://github.com/hjk789/NXEnhanced)-like features. The developer of NXEnhanced has ceased development of his project after attempting to work with NextDNS and recieving no response.
- Changes (additions, removals, edits) of NextDNS payment methods.

## Is this app secure? Can you access my account or view my DNS queries?

This is one of the benefits of open source! Anyone can look at all the code and verify for themselves that nothing nafarious is occuring with your data. NextDNS Manager has no access to your account and simply is a way to access the official dashboard on the go. You can think of the app as a very simplified web browser within an app that will only display NextDNS related sites. No information about the app (or your account) leaves your device.

## I am new to using NextDNS and I don't understand how to use it, can you teach me?

Because NextDNS support and communication from the developers is lacking, I am happy to try and help any users that open an issue or discussions post. For simple setup/configuration questions or specific questions about this app and its features, I will do whatever I can to help users get to a point where their configuration is working. 

I also recommend the r/nextdns community on Reddit, there are many knowledgeable people who can help as well.

## I've read all of this and still have a question, what now?
